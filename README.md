# Project Overview

This project is to explore the correlations (if any) between socioeconomic standings of communities and the availability of plant-based restaurants

## Executive Summary

## How to Reproduce
1. Download Data Files and save into a folder named Data inside your main folder:
> - [IRS Income by zipcode](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-individual-income-tax-statistics-2017-zip-code-data-soi)
> - [Vegan Restaurants](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/vegetarian-vegan-restaurants)

## Deliverables

## Project Planning

**Acquisition, Prep, and Initial Exploration**
- Collect all files

- Create a dataframe using pandas for each file
> After each file was collected into the Data folder, I read them into pandas one by one for cleaning and preparation

- Clean and prepare the data to perform aggregations and merge each dataframe together

- Look at shape of data

## Exploration

**Initial Hypotheses**

> The more affluent a community is the more likely they are to have a plant based restaurant.

**Tested Hypotheses**
