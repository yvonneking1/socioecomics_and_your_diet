## Deliverables

## Project Planning

**Acquisition, Prep, and Initial Exploration**
- Collect all files

- Create a dataframe using pandas for each file
> After each file was collected into the Data folder, I read them into pandas one by one for cleaning and preparation

- Clean and prepare the data to perform aggregations and merge each dataframe together

- Look at shape of data

## Exploration

**Initial Hypotheses**

> The more affluent a community is the more likely they are to have a plant based restaurant.
